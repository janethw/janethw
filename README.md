## Hi

## Let me introduce myself...

I am a software engineer who recently completed a Code First Girls Software Degree along with various other courses including Harvard's CS50x and CS50 Artificial Intelligence with Python on EdX.

## About Me
I discovered a love of software engineering when I set out to learn Python programming a few years ago. The concept of solving logical problems and understanding the systems and networks of our digital lives is what captivates me most about software engineering. While I haven't held a professional software engineering position yet, I have enjoyed working collaboratively with other developers and continue to build my skills and knowledge. 

## Skills
I have gained knowledge of the following programming languages and tools:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- MySQL
- Dependency management
- OOP
- CI/CD
- Cloud Fundamentals

## Collaborative Projects
I worked collaboratively with fellow developers on the following projects:

1. **Recipeasy**: This Flask web app was developed to encourage parents and children to make delicious dishes and learn about food. It has a recipe finder function and a quiz for children. It is written in OOP using the Flask framework and a MySQL database. It both calls on an external API and implements API endpoints for the MySQL database. Additionally, it incorporates logging and unit testing.

2. **Library**: This console webapp is written in Python and connects to a MySQL database. The front-end is the user console, which allows users to search for books, check them out and return them.

3. **Quiz**: Quiz was my first collaborative build. It is based on client-side technologies and built using CodePen.

## Other Projects
I was interested in machine learning and natural language processing and worked on the following projects. I've also done some other projects (not yet uploaded) using machine learning algorithms and neural networks on standard datasets; I found the Jason Brownlee e-books very helpful.

1. **Genetic Algorith**: This project was set as an exercise in the Lazy Programmer Udemy Course. The task was to use a genetic algorithm for decryption. 

2. **NLP Web Scraper**: This project is a web scraper, which was developed with the BeautifulSoup library.
